## Description

This project is a simple e-commerce web application built using **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. It fetches products from the **Fake Store API** and allows users to add or remove items from a shopping cart. The cart state is managed using React's component state, and the layout is fully responsive, working well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Product List**: Products are fetched from the Fake Store API and displayed in a grid layout.
  
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to the cart. If the product is already in the cart, an alert will notify the user.
  
- **Remove from Cart**: Users can remove items from the cart via a "Remove from Cart" button.
  
- **Cart Count**: The number of products in the cart is displayed in the navbar.
  
- **Cart Modal**: The cart contents are displayed in a modal that can be opened by clicking on the cart button in the navbar.
  
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is fully responsive and adjusts for different screen sizes using **Tailwind CSS**.
